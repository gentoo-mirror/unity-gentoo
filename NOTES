* To rebuild all packages against new GTK libs using qdepends (part of app-portage/portage-utils):
emerge -1 `qdepends -CNQ x11-libs/gtk+ 2> /dev/null`

* Using portage tree libindicate packages
	- unity-indicators/indicator-appmenu requires
		dev-libs/libdbusmenu, dev-libs/libindicator and dev-libs/libappindicator all be built with x11-libs/gtk:2 support
	- Many indicators (bluetooth, weather, etc.) require dev-libs/libappindicator be built with Python GTK+-2.x bindings to function
	- Gentoo is in the position of dropping GTK+-2.x Ubuntu Ayatana libraries from tree so we must maintain our own versions of
		dev-libs/libdbusmenu
		dev-libs/libindicator
		dev-libs/libappindicator

* Core python deps. for the Dash lens to work
	dev-libs/dee
	dev-libs/libappindicator
	dev-libs/libunity
	unity-lenses/unity-lens-video

* By design, some indicators or their features will not appear until they meet certain criteria
	- indicator-messages	# Won't appear until a messaging type application is run first (eg. empathy, evolution (via indicator-evolution), pidgin, webapp)
	- indicator-keyboard	# Won't appear until at least one input source is specified and 'Show current input source in menu bar' is checked in System Settings > Text Entry
	- indicator-session	# Won't show username until 'Show my login in menu bar' is checked in System Settings > User Accounts
					and then only if user has been added to /etc/passwd using useradd's '--comment' GECOS field

* Unity user specific settings locations
	- Dconf registry accessible via gsettings or dconf-editor
	- ~/.{cache,config,local}/...
	- /var/lib/AccountsService/users/<user>

* Empathy and message indicator integration
	- To reset all empathy accounts and configurations:
		rm -rfv ~/.cache/telepathy
		rm -rfv ~/.local/share/telepathy
		rm -rfv ~/.config/libaccounts-glib
		rm -rfv ~/.config/Empathy
		rm -rfv ~/.cache/folks
		rm -rfv ~/.local/share/folks
	- To debug signond, edit /etc/signond.conf and change 'LoggingLevel=...'
	- To debug signon-ui:
		killall signon-ui
		export SSOUI_LOGGING_LEVEL=2
		signon-ui
	- To debug telepathy packages:
		G_MESSAGES_DEBUG=all FOO_PERSIST=1 FOO_DEBUG=all /path/to/telepathy-foo 2>&1 | tee foo.log

* Webapps integration
	- Requires the following packages:
		- dev-libs/libunity-webapps			(Integrates browser plugins with the desktop via libunity)
		- unity-base/webapps				(Contains site specific webapps)
		- unity-base/webapps-base			(Contains site specific webapps)
		- x11-misc/webapps-greasemonkey			(Unity Websites Integration browser plugin)
		- x11-misc/webaccounts-browser-extension	(Ubuntu Online Accounts browser plugin)
		- x11-misc/unity-firefox-extension		(Unity Desktop Integration browser plugin)
		- x11-misc/unity-chromium-extension		(Unity Desktop Integration browser plugin)

	- Problems:
		- 'unity-webapps-runner' (unity-base/unity-webapps) is used by the *.desktop files installed by
			Ubuntu packages but will only work if either chromium or firefox are set as the default browser
			Default browser setting is read from desktop user's ~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list
	- Other stuff:
		- Webapps shown in the messages indicator are provided by the desktop user's ~/.local/share/applications/<provider>.desktop
		- Available webapps are stored in the desktop user's ~/.local/share/unity-webapps/availableapps-v2.db
		- Installed webapps are stored in the desktop user's ~/.local/share/unity-webapps/apps2.db
	- To reset all installed webapps back to zero (and so get re-prompted to integrate each site), and remove indicator integration:
		rm -rfv ~/.local/share/applications/<webapp_provider>.desktop
		gsettings set com.canonical.unity.webapps allowed-domains ['']
		Reset browser extension installed websites:
			- Chromium:	Settings > Advanced Settings > Installed Websites > Exceptions
			- Firefox:	Edit > Preferences > Desktop Integration > Exceptions
	- Possible TODO:
		- Package Ubuntu's version of app-misc/geoclue so that the Amazon webapp regional settings work when running 'unity-webapps-runner -a'

* Debugging Unity
	- Emerge unity-base/unity with the 'debug' USE flag enabled, and restart xsession
	- Check ~/.xsession-errors and syslog
	- gsettings get org.compiz.core:/org/compiz/profiles/unity/plugins/core/ active-plugins

* Debugging top panel systray/indicator icons and menus
	- In desktop user's xterm, issue the following command:
		killall indicator-application-service; G_MESSAGES_DEBUG=all /usr/libexec/indicator-application/indicator-application-service
	- Get list of currently running indicators with the following command:
		dbus-send --type=method_call --print-reply --dest=com.canonical.indicator.application \
			/com/canonical/indicator/application/service com.canonical.indicator.application.service.GetApplications

* Ubuntu Single Signon
	- Check ~/.cache/sso/sso-client*.log

* Mir EGL Display Server
	- Circular dependencies between mir-base/mir and media-libs/mesa
		- Mesa requires mir support patch
		=== UTOPIC ===
		- mir-base/mir requires libGL from media-libs/mesa to build
		- media-libs/mesa with mir enabled requires mirclient from mir-base/mir
			- SOLUTION:
				- Introduce media-libs/mesa-mir ebuild that installs only the mesa EGL related files and DEPENDS on mir-base/mir
				- Introduce 'mir' useflag to media-libs/mesa which when enabled removes all EGL related files and PDEPENDS on media-libs/mesa-mir
		=== VIVID ===
		- mir-base/mir now requires entire vanilla media-libs/mesa[-mir] to build
		- media-libs/mesa with mir enabled requires mirclient from mir-base/mir
			- SOLUTION:
				- Remove and block media-libs/mesa-mir ebuild
				- Insert check in media-libs/mesa ebuild that dies with message if mesa is trying to build with mir enabled before mir-base/mir is installed
		-- (This needs to be revisited, perhaps split mirclient into it's own separate package...)

* Ubuntu use the 'upstart' init system to start desktop services, notes below:
	* '/usr/bin/upstart --user' sets the $UPSTART_SESSION env variable
		- $UPSTART_SESSION env variable will only be set (inherited from upstart process) if the desktop session is a child process of the parent 'upstart' process
			ie. Upstart cannot be started within the desktop session, upstart needs to be the process that starts the desktop session
	* /usr/bin/initctl needs the $UPSTART_SESSION env variable set for it's many jobs to execute correctly
	* To communicate properly over dbus, the dbus process also needs to be a child of the upstart process (as started by /usr/share/upstart/sessions/dbus.conf)

$ echo $UPSTART_SESSION 
unix:abstract=/com/ubuntu/upstart-session/1000/6350

## Upstart Session Launch ##
* On xsession start, /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc.d/99upstart-systemd sets the required env variables and launches 'exec upstart --user'
	- Note that no other file after '99upstart-systemd' in alphanumerical order will be parsed
* Upstart processes it's *.conf files in /usr/share/upstart/sessions/

## Systemd Session Launch ##
* As of Yakkety release, Canonical are starting to move from upstart to 'systemd --user' *.service units to start desktop sessions and services
* Unity session is launched as follows:
	- /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc.d/99upstart-systemd starts '/usr/bin/upstart --user'
		- Upstart job '/usr/share/upstart/systemd-session/upstart/systemd-graphical-session.conf' starts 'systemctl --user start ${DESKTOP_SESSION}-session.target'
		- Every '/usr/share/upstart/systemd-session/upstart/<service>.override' file that has the word 'manual' in it, is skipped being started by upstart

	- The following services have not yet been migrated to use systemd and still use upstart *.conf files to start:
		- unity-base/hud
			/usr/libexec/hud/dbus-activation-hack.sh then starts /usr/libexec/hud/hud-service
		- net-misc/url-dispatcher (currently disabled due to causing Unity desktop logout lag)
		- All indicators (application,bluetooth,datetime,keyboard,messages,power,printers,session,sound)
		
	- Once Canonical have fully migrated 'systemd --user' to start all desktop services, the following can be expected:
		- Display manager (eg.lightdm) executes /usr/share/xsessions/unity.desktop:
		- '/usr/share/xsessions/unity.desktop' executes '/usr/libexec/run-systemd-session unity-session.target'
		- '/usr/libexec/run-systemd-session unity-session.target' runs 'systemctl --user start --wait unity-session.target'
		- '/usr/lib/systemd/user/unity-session.target' starts:
			- 'gnome-session.service' which in turn executes 'gnome-session --session=unity'
			- 'unity7.service' is auto-started due to existence of '/usr/lib/systemd/user/unity-session.target.requires/unity7.service' symlink
		- All other Unity systemd service units are then started as being 'PartOf=graphical-session.target'
		- Most importantly, unity7.service unit does the following:
			- Executes '/usr/lib/unity/systemd-prestart-check' to check if we're in an upstart or systemd session
			- Sets the compizconfig profile to 'COMPIZ_CONFIG_PROFILE=ubuntu' via '/usr/lib/unity/compiz-profile-selector'
			- Performs 'ExecStart=/usr/bin/compiz'
			- Pulls in and starts {unity-settings-daemon,unity-panel-service,bamfdaemon}.service units

## Unity8 Session Launch ##
	- Lightdm reads /usr/share/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/45-unity8.conf and so executes '/usr/bin/unity-system-compositor.sleep' and '/usr/bin/lightdm-unity8-session'
	- Lightdm executes /usr/bin/unity-system-compositor.sleep --file '/run/mir_socket' --from-dm-fd 13 --to-dm-fd 22 --vt 8
	   \_ /usr/bin/unity-system-compositor.sleep executes /usr/sbin/unity-system-compositor --disable-inactivity-policy=true --on-fatal-error-abort $@
	- Lightdm executes /usr/share/lightdm/sessions/unity8.desktop
	   \_ /usr/share/lightdm/sessions/unity8.desktop executes /usr/bin/lightdm-unity8-session
	     \_ /usr/bin/lightdm-unity8-session sets the following ${ENV} variables and executes 'upstart --user':
			unset QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME
			export QT_QPA_PLATFORM=ubuntumirclient
			export UNITY_INDICATOR_PROFILE=desktop
			export UBUNTU_PLATFORM_API_BACKEND=desktop_mirclient
	       \_ 'upstart --user' starts /usr/share/upstart/sessions/unity8.conf
		 \_ unity8.conf triggers on SESSION=unity8, points /run/user/<uid>/mir_socket at /run/mir_socket and starts '/usr/bin/unity8 --mode=full-shell'

## Compiz performance settings for 'ccsm' ##
 Click on "OpenGL" and set "Texture Filter" to Fast.
 Make sure "Sync to V blank" is selected, that Texture Compression is NOT selected, and make sure Frame Buffer, Vertex Buffer, and Always Use Buffer Swapping ARE all selected.
 Scroll down to "Image Loading" and make sure all options (jpeg, png, svg, and text) ARE selected.
 * Some applications such as Steam or Chromium with hardware acceleration enabled may lose window focus particularly after unminising the window or waking from screen lock/blank
	- Enabling the 'Keep previews' option under 'Compiz Workarounds' fixes this issue
