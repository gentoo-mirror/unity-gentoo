* USE="doc debug mono tests"
* Audit DEPEND and RDEPEND lists
* Convert all ebuilds to EAPI=6 and remove use of base.eclass
	('autotools-{multilib,utils}','gnome2','kde-4' and 'qt4-r2' block EAPI6 upgrade)
* Swap around ebuild naming convention so that for example:
	trust-store-2.0.0_p0_p01_p2015083103
  becomes
	trust-store-2.0.0_p2015083103_p0_p01
  In this way progressive version bumps will always be seen by emerge as upgrades
